Description: zipper-like comonad which works as a list, tracking a position${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This Haskell library provides PointedList, which tracks the position in a
 non-empty list which works similarly to a zipper. A current item is always
 required, and therefore the list may never be empty. A circular PointedList
 wraps around to the other end when progressing past the actual edge.
 .
 This package contains the normal library files.
