Description: Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) Runtime System.
 The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) defines a portable instruction set and file
 format. It is specifically designed to execute languages with non-strict (or
 lazy) semantics.
 .
 This package defines an LVM runtime written in C. The LVM is used as a backend
 for the Helium compiler.
 .
 More information about LVM can be found in Chapter 6
 of Daan Leijen's PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.
