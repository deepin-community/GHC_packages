Description: Haskell web framework - GHC libraries
 Happstack is a web framework written in Haskell; it provides a rich
 collection of types and functions for routing Requests, generating
 Responses, working with query parameters, form data, and cookies,
 serving files and more.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC. Anyway, it is
 just a stub, depending on the package that actually provides the
 Happstack server.
