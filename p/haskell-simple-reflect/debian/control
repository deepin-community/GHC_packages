Description: simple reflection of expressions containing variables${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This package allows simple reflection of expressions containing variables.
 Reflection here means that a Haskell expression is turned into a string.
 .
 The primary aim of this package is teaching and understanding;
 there are no options for manipulating the reflected expressions beyond
 showing them.
