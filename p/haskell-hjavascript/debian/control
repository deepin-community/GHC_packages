Description: Haskell abstract syntax for a subset of JavaScript - GHC libraries
 HJavaScript defines a Haskell abstract syntax and pretty printer for a
 subset of JavaScript. However, a significant difference from JavaScript
 is that HJavaScript is typed, even on the abstract syntax level using
 GADTs. The subset of JavaScript that is supported is those parts that
 lend themself to typing (i.e. no prototyping of classes).
 .
 If you don't know what Haskell and all these concepts are, you can just
 ignore this package.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
