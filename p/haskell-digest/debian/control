Description: efficient cryptographic hash implementations for bytestrings
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This package provides efficient cryptographic hash implementations for strict
 and lazy bytestrings. For now, CRC32 and Adler32 are supported; they are
 implemented as FFI bindings to efficient code from zlib.

Package: libghc6-digest-prof
Architecture: any
Depends: ${haskell:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: efficient cryptographic hash implementations bytestrings; profiling library
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language,
 compiled for profiling.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
