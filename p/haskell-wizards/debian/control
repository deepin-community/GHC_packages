X-Description: library for interrogative programs
 This library is a package designed for the quick and painless development of
 interrogative programs, which revolve around a "dialogue" with the user, who
 is asked a series of questions in a sequence much like an installation wizard.
 .
 Everything from interactive system scripts, to installation wizards, to
 full-blown shells can be implemented with the support of wizards.
 .
 It is developed transparently on top of a free monad, which separates out the
 semantics of the program from any particular interface. A variety of backends
 exist, including console-based System.Console.Wizard.Haskeline and
 System.Console.Wizard.BasicIO, and the pure System.Console.Wizard.Pure. It is
 also possible to write your own backends, or extend existing back-ends with
 new features. While both built-in IO backends operate on a console, there is
 no reason why wizards cannot also be used for making GUI wizard interfaces.
