    - split-objs was not enabled in the previous upload as it breaks the
      profiling build
    - Split build-stamp target in a build-arch-stamp and a
      build-indep-stamp so the build daemons do not try to build the
      architecture independent stuff. (Closes: #478899)

haskell-uulib (0.9.3~snapshot20071230-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot release:
      - Many functions, like delete and insertMany, were returning invalid
        multisets. Namely, multisets where zero-occurrences are explicitly
        modelled. This is incorrect, and they were fixed so that they return
        valid multisets.
      - There is also a fix to multiset unions which was handling
        overlapping elements incorrectly. The fix changes the strictness of
        this function however.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump build depency on haskell-devscripts to 0.6.0 which ships
      dh_haskell_depends and generates haddock API documentation.
    - Replace the XS-Vcs* with the now official Vcs* fields.
    - Add the new Homepage field.
    - Drop dctrl-tools from the Build-Depends as the mk-haskell-depends
      scripts, which needed it, is removed from the source package.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3. No changes needed.
  * debian/mk-haskell-depends:
    - Removed as haskell-devscripts now ships dh_haskell_depends
  * debian/rules:
    - Move package specific parts in variables at the top of the
      makefile.
    - dh_haskell_install does not install empty directories anymore and
      removes empty directories from the GHC package configuration
      file, so stop doing this manually.
    - dh_haskell also generates the haddock documentation so stop calling
      ./setup haddock
    - Replace the call to debian/mk-haskell-depends with a call to
      dh_haskell_depends.
    - Make ./configure executable before running it.

        packages.
      + Add libghc6-base-doc and libghc6-haskell98-doc to the Recommends
        of haskell-uulib-doc.

      configuration files.
    - Don't compress .haddock files so they can be used by haddock.
  * Stop using update-haskell-control and $ghc6_* variables, as it is not
    necessary and not using it simplifies the work for porters and for me.
