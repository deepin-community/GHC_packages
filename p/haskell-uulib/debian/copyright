The UU.DData modules which consists of the files IntBag.hs,
IntMap.hs, IntSet.hs, Map.hs, MultiSet.hs, Queue.hs, Scc.hs, Seq.hs
and Set.hs in the UU/DData directory and the UU.PPretty module which
consists of file UU/PPretty.hs are licensed under a BSD-style
license. Unfortunately the explicit licenses are not mentioned in the
source files.

After some email correspondence with the upstream maintainer and the
author of the UU.DData modules I received an email with points out the
explicit license terms:

   Hello Arjan, I had a chat with Daan over the license and he said that
   his libraries can be licensed with the same license as darcs-server.

   I still want to keep your patch to use s libraries, I think s the way
   to go. However I want to keep the UU.DData.Seq, instead of the
   gratuitous dependency on Edison. So this would be the only module to
   which the license will apply.

   Sorry for the late reply, I just started a traineeship at Microsoft
   Research and I was busy like crazy completing some work in Utrecht.

   Cheers,

   Alexey
