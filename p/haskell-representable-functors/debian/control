Description: Representable functors${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This package provides a generalized Store comonad, parameterized by a
 Representable functor (the representation of that functor serves as the index
 of the store) and a generalized State monad, parameterized by a Representable
 functor (the representation of that functor serves as the state).
 .
 Representable functors on Hask all monads, being isomorphic to a reader monad.
 .
 Representable contravariant endofunctors over the category of Haskell types
 are isomorphic to (_ -> r) and resemble mappings to a fixed range.
 .
 Representable endofunctors over the category of Haskell types are isomorphic
 to the reader monad and so inherit a very large number of properties for free.
