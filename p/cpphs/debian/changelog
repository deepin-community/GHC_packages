cpphs (0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile with GHC on all platforms so we don't get the file encoding
    issues that "compiling" with hugs gives us. Drop the nhc98 and hugs
    build-dep choices.
  * Don't suggest nhc98 as it is not in the archive any more.
  * Standards version bumped to 3.7.2.

cpphs (0.7-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * C++ ABI transition: It's linked against libgmp3 and needs rebuild.
    Change build dependency order to prefer hugs over ghc6 since that is
    the only alternative that currently is installable.
    This also has as effect that the libgmp3 dependency gets dropped.

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Thu,  1 Sep 2005 18:31:03 +0200

cpphs (0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix build-deps so arches without ghc6 ought to build.
  * Remove mips from list of ghc6 arches as it is to be removed.
