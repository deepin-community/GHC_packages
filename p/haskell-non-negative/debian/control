Description: Non-negative numbers for Haskell
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This library provides a class for non-negative numbers, a wrapper which
 can turn any ordered numeric type into a member of that class, and a
 lazy number type for non-negative numbers (a generalization of Peano
 numbers).
