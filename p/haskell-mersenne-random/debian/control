Description: SIMD Fast Mersenne Twister generator of pseudo-random numbers
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by Makoto
 Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear recurrence
 over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation of very
 high-quality pseudo-random numbers.
 .
 This library uses SFMT, the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister, a variant
 of Mersenne Twister that is much faster than the original.
 .
 By default the period of the function is 2^19937-1. Note that this algorithm
 on its own is not cryptographically secure.
