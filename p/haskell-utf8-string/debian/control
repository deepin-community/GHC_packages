Package: libghc6-utf8-string-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: ${haskell:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: GHC 6 libraries for the Haskell UTF-8 library
 UTF8 layer for IO and Strings. The utf8-string package provides operations
 for encoding UTF8 strings to Word8 lists and back, and for reading and
 writing UTF8 without truncation.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.

Package: libghc6-utf8-string-prof
Architecture: any
Depends: ${haskell:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libghc6-utf8-string-dev (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Profiling support for the GHC 6 Haskell UTF-8 library
 UTF8 layer for IO and Strings. The utf8-string package provides operations
 for encoding UTF8 strings to Word8 lists and back, and for reading and
 writing UTF8 without truncation.
 .
 This package contains additional GHC profiling libraries which can be used with
 libghc6-utf8-string-dev.
