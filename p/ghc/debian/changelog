ghc6 (6.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add powerpc to the list of arches to do a registerised build with
    object splitting.
  * Fix checkFEDArgs in ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcForeign.lhs so it compiles
    again.
  * Remove OpenGL and GLUT packages from package.conf.shipped.
    Have the postinst/prerm add/remove them.
  * ghc6-hopengl provides libghc6-{opengl,glut}-{dev,prof}
  * Other exposed libraries are provided as libghc6-foo-dev by ghc6 and
    libghc6-foo-prof by ghc6-prof.

  * Rejig how files are put in the right packages to follow upstream changes.
  * Separate build target into build and install.
  * No longer allow ghc4 or ghc5 to be used for building as they are no longer
    supported.
  * Handle /usr/bin/ghc6 et al. and the alternatives without the 6 suffix
    better.
  * Add a /usr/bin/runhaskell alternative, priority 8600000600.

ghc6 (6.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add "Modes of operation" flags to flag reference in the users guide,
    and hence to the automatically generated manpage.
  * Create /usr/bin/ghc-pkg6.
  * Revert changes to support mips/mipsel. They need changes in
    glibc/gcc to work, supported by different changes in ghc.
  * Support the spirit of noopt and nostrip values of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
  * Make symlinks for /usr/bin/{ghc,ghc-pkg,ghci}-$version into
    /usr/lib/ghc-$version/bin/.
  * Add manpage symlinks for {ghc,ghci}-$version.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1.
  * Remove mention of threaded packages from the manpage as they no
    longer exist.
  * Add grep-dctrl to build-dep list and use grep-status to build a
    depends line for the set of installed packages providing
    libreadline-dev (should have cardinality 1).
    Replaced libreadline4-dev dependency with ${readline}.
    Switch order of libreadline4-dev and libreadline-dev in build-deps
    so the concrete package is first.
  * Change how configure/config.sub/config.guess are handled in line
    with /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/README.Debian.gz.
  * Added varfile /usr/lib/haskell-utils/ghc6_vars.
  * Remove docs/building/building.out and
    ghc6-6.2.2/docs/docbook-cheat-sheet/docbook-cheat-sheet.out when
    cleaning.

ghc6 (6.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Join build-deps onto a single line.

  * Build-dep on xlibs-dev for building the X11 package.
  * Additionally build the RTS the following ways:
    debug_p thr_debug thr_debug_p
    (which, together with those done by default, gives us all ways).
  * Install initial /usr/lib/ghc-$version/package.conf as
    /usr/lib/ghc-$version/package.conf.shipped and copy it to
    /usr/lib/ghc-$version/package.conf in postinst if it doesn't exist.
    This means other library information isn't lost across upgrades.
  * Remove /usr/lib/ghc-$version/package.conf{,.old} in postrm purge.

  * Don't use -static on any arches (remove per-arch "-static"s in

  * We now depend and build-depend on "gcc-3.3 (>= 1:3.3.3-2)" which should
    give correct code on all arches.

ghc6 (6.0.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unregisterised builds should be possible for any architecture, so
    set the architecture to any.
  * Add s390, m68k, mips, hppa, arm and powerpc Linux to configure{,.in}
  * Write a README.Debian about the registerised/unregisterised deal.

    (otherwise) in debian/ghc6.substvars
  * Removed quotes around ${WithGhc-ghc} in configure and aclocal.m4 so
    arguments can be given (e.g. to point at a certain gcc) with the
    flag
  * Pass flags giving the location of ghc and, in the case of sparc,
    gcc to ./configure
  * Added sparc to Architecture field of the packages

    line) depend on ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
  * Create a /usr/bin/ghc6 and /usr/bin/ghci6
  * Also build a threaded-rts binary and make various related -threaded files
    and symlinks. Put in a separate package (ghc6-threaded-rts) due to size.

    + Removed comments from cpp functions in a couple of source files to
      counteract changes in 3.3 meaning they didn't compile
    + Evil mangler tweaked to allow extra whitespace gcc 3.3 puts in
      and for changes to generated assembly for _module_registered
    + Rename "--list-packages-local" to "--list-local-packages"
  * Added missing quotes to
    libraries/OpenGL/Graphics/Rendering/OpenGL/GL/Extensions.hs
    so it compiles

    be in its own package anyway as I imagine it is equally useful with
    any Haskell compiler
  * Changed libraries/OpenGL/specs/enumerant to use this compiler rather
    than the installed one; in particular this means that the profiling
    libraries don't need to be installed
