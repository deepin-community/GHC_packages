Description: GHC - the Glasgow Haskell Compilation system
 Version 6 of the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation system (GHC).  GHC is
 a compiler for Haskell98.
 .
 Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language. Haskell98
 is the current version of the language. The language definition and
 additional documentation can be found in the `haskell-doc' package.
 Alternatively, there is an online version at
