long_description=" This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing\n streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library so\n it has high performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\" compression\n formats.\n .\n It provides a convenient high level api suitable for most tasks and for the\n few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib\n feature set."
