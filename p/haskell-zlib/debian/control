Package: libghc6-zlib-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: ${haskell:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: haskell-zlib-doc (= ${binary:Version}), libghc6-zlib-prof (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
 streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library so
 it has high performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"
 compression formats.
 .
 It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the
 few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib
 feature set.

Architecture: any
Depends: libghc6-zlib-dev (= ${binary:Version}), ${haskell:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats; profiling libraries
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language,
 compiled for profiling.
