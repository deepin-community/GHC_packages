Description: Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
 streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library so
 it has high performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"
 compression formats.
 .
 It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the
 few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib
 feature set.
