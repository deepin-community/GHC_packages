Description: Generic programming library for Haskell
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This package contains the generics system known as "Scrap Your Boilerplate".
 It defines the "Data" class of types permitting folding and unfolding of
 constructor applications, instances of this class for primitive types, and a
 variety of traversals.
