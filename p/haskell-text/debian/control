Description: An efficient packed Unicode text type for Haskell - GHC 6 libraries
 This is a Haskell time and space-efficient implementation of Unicode
 text using packed Word16 arrays.  Suitable for performance critical use,
 both in terms of large data quantities and high speed.
 .
 It supports many basic string operations and has some substring search
 tools.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
