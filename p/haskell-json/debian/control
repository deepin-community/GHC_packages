Description: Haskell library for serialising data to and from JSON
 .
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It
 is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and
 generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
 Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
 .
 This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting between
 Haskell values and JSON.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
