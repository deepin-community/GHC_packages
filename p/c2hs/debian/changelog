c2hs (0.15.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/c2hs.1: Added temporarily.
  * debian/c2hs.install:
    - Updated for new release.
  * debian/control:
    - Add alex and happy to the Build-Depends.
    - Drop autotools-dev from the Build-Depends as the config.{sub,guess}
      files are not needed anymore.
    - Temporarily stop building the c2hs-doc package as upstream
      accidentally did not ship documentation with this release.
  * debian/patches:
    - Disabled 01_update-manpage and 11_documentation-fix as the tarball
      does not ship any documentation.
    - Removed 02_generate-manpage, 03_install-manpage,
      04_add-destdir-support, 05_fix-tests, 08_fix-autoconf-warning,
      10_update-configure and 12_nostrip.
      The build system no longer uses autotools and makefiles.
    - Removed 06_fix-Setup-for-ghc-6.4.2, 07_new-Data.Set-api and
      09_replace-deprecated-withObject. Fixes are included upstream
  * debian/rules:
    - Tarball does not ship tests or documentation so removed
      corresponding lines from debian/rules.
    - No need to copy up-to-date config.{sub,guess} files as they are not
      used anymore.
    - ./setup configure does not create a config.status file anymore, so
      instead touch configure-stamp at the end of the configure target.

    occurrences of 'withObject' with 'with' as the deprecated 'withObject'
    was removed with GHC 6.6. (Closes: #402979)
  * Set the urgency to medium as the above bug decreases c2hs usefulness
    with GHC 6.6 dramatically.

c2hs (0.14.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix broken debian/rules:
    - Let build only depend on binary-arch as dpkg-buildpackage (and thus

      architecture dependent packages. (thanks Kari Pahula)
    - Fix bashism.  (thanks John Goerzen)

    - replace ${Source-Version} with ${binary:Version} and
      ${source:Version} to make the package binNMU safe.
