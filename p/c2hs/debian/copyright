License:
 All code included into generated bindings is under a BSD-style license that
 does not place any restrictions on the license of the inteface produced with
 C->Haskell (ie, closed proprietary licenses are possible, too).  In other
 words, I do not care what you use C->Haskell for or to whom you are giving
 C->Haskell or any interfaces generated with C->Haskell, only if you modify or
 improve C->Haskell itself, you have to contribute your changes back to the
 community.  Nevertheless, I will of course be particularly delighted if you
 choose to make your work freely available.
