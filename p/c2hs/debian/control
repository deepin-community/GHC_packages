Description: C->Haskell Interface Generator
 C->Haskell is an interface generator that simplifies the development
 of Haskell bindings to C libraries.  The tool processes existing C
 header files that determine data layout and function signatures on
 the C side in conjunction with Haskell modules that specify
 Haskell-side type signatures and marshaling details.  Hooks embedded
 in the Haskell code signal access to C structures and functions --
 they are expanded by the interfacing tool in dependence on
 information from the corresponding C header file.
 .
 Haskell 98 is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
 More info plus the language definition is at http://www.haskell.org/.
 .
 This package contains the c2hs parser.
