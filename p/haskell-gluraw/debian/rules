# haskell-gluraw needs a lot of memory during compilation.
# Unfortunately, this amount of memory is not available on all platforms,
# and error: "virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory." could appear.
#
# In this case possible solution could be using ggc-min-expand.
# This parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the
# garbage collectorâ€™s heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
# Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.
