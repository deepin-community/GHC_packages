Description: Transformers for Reader and State Monoids
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This library provides Monoid Transformers for the Reader Monoid and
 the State Monoid. There's no Monoid Transformer for the Writer Monoid
 since the Writer Monad transforms a Monoid into a Monad.
