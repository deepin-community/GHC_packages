Description: Pure specification of the IO monad${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 It consists of several modules, that give a pure specification
 of functions in the IO monad:
 .
 Test.IOSpec.Fork: a pure specification of forkIO.
 .
 Test.IOSpec.IORef: a pure specification of most functions that create and
 manipulate on IORefs.
 .
 Test.IOSpec.MVar: a pure specification of most functions that create and
 manipulate and MVars.
 .
 Test.IOSpec.STM: a pure specification of atomically and the STM monad.
 .
 Test.IOSpec.Teletype: a pure specification of getChar, putChar, and
 several related Prelude functions.
 .
 Besides these modules containing the specifications, there are a few other
 important modules:
 .
 Test.IOSpec.Types: defines the IOSpec type and several amenities.
 .
 Test.IOSpec.VirtualMachine: defines a virtual machine on which to execute
 pure specifications.
 .
 Test.IOSpec.Surrogate: a drop-in replacement for the other modules. Import
 this and recompile your code once you've finished testing and debugging.
 .
 There are several well-documented examples included with the source
 distribution.
 .
