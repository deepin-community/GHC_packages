hmake (3.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    * Builds with GHC 6.6. Closes: #393582.
    * Dropped patch to src/interpreter/HInteractive.hs (unnecessary
      now cpp is not used on that file).
    * Dropped patch to script/confhc (upstream applied an alternate fix).
    * Dropped patch to src/hmake/PackageConfig.hs (upstream applied an
      alternate fix).
    * Dropped patch to src/interpreter/Makefile (applied upstream).
    * Dropped patch to man/hmake.1 (applied upstream).
    * Dropped patch to Makefile (applied upstream).
  * make realclean rather than merely clean.
  * Added hacks to clean .hi files that get left behind.
  * Drop README that just pointed at the upstream website.
  * Updated debian/control so the new GHC arches get included.
  * Apply:
      Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk**20061030104744
      module Readline is now called System.Console.Readline,
      and it lives in -package readline instead of -package util (or wherever
      it used to be).
    (affects script/fixghc, src/interpreter/Makefile and
     src/interpreter/SimpleLineEditor.hs).

hmake (3.10-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Applied patches from Stefan Potyra to fix bug reported by Daniel
    Schepler to adapt to output changes in new ghc6 version that make
    "__GLASGOW_HASKELL__" be expanded into many lines instead of one.
    scripts/confhc uses the output to create lib/debian/config, and
    makes assumptions about the format. Similarly for
    src/interpreter/HInteractive.hs. Closes: #335842.

hmake (3.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Closes: #309837.
  * Remove $nhc98_app_bdeps option from build-deps as nhc98 is being
    removed from Debian.
  * Escape ${shlibs:Depends} in debian/control.in for
    update-haskell-control.
  * Bump standards version to 3.6.2.
  * Run update-haskell-control.
  * Set DEBIAN env var when configuring so the dynamic compilers are
    added to the config rather than the installed static ones.
  * Built against new libgmp3-dev. Closes: #329912.
  * Use \[:o] in the hmake manpage rather than the actual character from
    some charset.

hmake (3.09-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have in-tree harch just "echo debian".
  * Set MACHINE to debian rather than calling harch in /usr/bin/*.
    Closes: #300620.
  * Remove /usr/bin/harch (and it's manpage) as it is no longer needed.
  * Update build-deps to reflect nhc98 not being available for m68k or sparc.

 -- Ian Lynagh (wibble) <igloo@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Mar 2005 11:06:59 +0000

hmake (3.09-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ian Lynagh (wibble) <igloo@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Jan 2005 20:47:32 +0000

hmake (3.09-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated debian/copyright.
  * Use `dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH`-`uname` to create harch.
    Fixes problems where the existing implementation doesn't know some
    names need to be unified.
  * Use update-haskell-control to generate debian/control from a control.in.
    Use vars for the compiler info. Closes: #253218.
  * Call update-haskell-control --check in debian/rules.
  * Policy version bumped to 3.6.1 (no other changes necessary).
  * Removed debian/hmake.undocumented as we don't even call dh_undocumented
    any more.
  * Remove debian/hi.1 when making clean.
  * Fix type (srcipt -> script) in debian/in-rules.
  * Made watch file

hmake (3.08-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add m68k to the list of arches that can use ghc6 as a build-dep.
  * Require ghc6 >= 6.2.1-1 to avoid the static linking in earlier
    versions on some arches.

 -- Ian Lynagh (wibble) <igloo@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Apr 2004 21:07:31 +0000

hmake (3.08-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use runAndReadStdout to find out what a compiler is rather than
    playing games with return statuses. Works around an nhc98 bug
    in reporting process exit statuses.

 -- Ian Lynagh (wibble) <igloo@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Feb 2004 23:55:44 +0000

hmake (3.08-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't call dh_undocumented
  * Install hmakerc into /var/lib/... rather than /usr/lib/... for FHS
    reasons. Closes: 222987.
  * Don't generate an md5sum for hmakerc as it will never match.

 -- Ian Lynagh (wibble) <igloo@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Oct 2003 17:32:19 +0000

hmake (3.08-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add an nhc98 build-dep alternative to ghc for those arches that have it.
  * Tweak hi so it copes with dynamic compilers.
  * Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages
  * Write hi manpage.

 -- Ian Lynagh (wibble) <igloo@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Oct 2003 17:32:19 +0000

hmake (3.08-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove erroneous commas in arch list in build-dep.
  * Change maintainer field to me.

hmake (3.08-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get arch list and version options the right way round in build-dep.

hmake (3.08-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Tidy up debian/rules
  * Patch so it can guess compiler types based on their output, not just
    their name.
  * Patch so it is possible to have the compiler type determined at use
    time rather than configure time.
  * Pass configure --buildwith=/usr/bin/haskell-compiler
  * Build-dep on (suitably recent) ghc6 on arches where it is available.
  * Depend on a ghc6, ghc5 or nhc98 recent enough to provide
    /usr/bin/haskell-compiler and suggest all 3.
  * Remove the hat and nhc98-doc suggestions.
  * Put 4 in debian/compat, build-depend on debhelper accordingly and update
    things to install into debian/hmake rather than debian/tmp.
  * Register with and depend on haskell-utils
  * Remove self-conflict.
  * Don't copy the CVS directory into /usr/share/doc/hmake/html
