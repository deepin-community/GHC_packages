Description: Priority Search Queue
 A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the
 opperations of both a search tree and a priority queue. A
 'Binding' is a product of a key and a priority.  Bindings
 can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in
 logarithmic time, and the binding with the least priority
 can be retrieved in constant time.  A queue can be built
 from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.
 .
 This package contains the normal library files.
