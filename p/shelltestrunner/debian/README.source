Note that the version is embedded in the source file via a local
patch, as cabal-th is not (yet?) available on many architectures. As
such, when importing new upstream versions, the patch should be
refreshed.

Also note that the built man page is stored in VCS and distributed, in
order to remove the dependency on pandoc. To (re)built it, install
pandoc and then run:

make -f debian/rules debian/shelltest.1
