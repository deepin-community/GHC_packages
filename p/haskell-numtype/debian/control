Description: type-level (low cardinality) integers${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This package provides unary type level representations of the (positive
 and negative) integers and basic operations (addition, subtraction,
 multiplication, division) on these. Due to the unary implementation the
 practical size of the NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable
 for large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with integers
 beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn't for you.
 .
 It is, however, eminently suitable for applications such as representing
 physical dimensions (see the Dimensional library).
