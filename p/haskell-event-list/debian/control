Description: Event lists with relative or absolute timestamps
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This library provides lists to manage events that are associated with
 times. Times may be given as difference between successive events or as
 absolute time values. Pauses before the first and after the last event
 are supported. The data structures can be used to represent MIDI files,
 OpenSoundControl message streams, music performances etc.
