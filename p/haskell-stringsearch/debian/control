Description: Fast searching, splitting and replacing of ByteStrings${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This package provides several functions to quickly
 search for substrings in strict or lazy ByteStrings.
 It also provides functions for breaking or splitting
 on substrings and replacing all occurrences of a
 substring (the first in case of overlaps) with another.
