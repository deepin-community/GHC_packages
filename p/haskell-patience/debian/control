Description: Haskell implementation of the Patience Diff algorithm${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This library implements the "patience diff" algorithm, as well as the patience
 algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem.
 .
 Patience diff computes the difference between two lists, for example the lines
 of two versions of a source file. It provides a good balance of performance,
 nice output for humans, and implementation simplicity. For more information,
 see http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html and
