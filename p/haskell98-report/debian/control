Description: The Haskell 98 Language and Libraries Revised Report & addenda
 Haskell is a non-strict, pure functional general-purpose programming
 language.  This package contains its definition in HTML, PS and PDF
 formats. It is a revised version of "The Haskell 98 Report" and
 "The Haskell 98 Library Report", fixing the bugs documented in
 "Errata for the Haskell 98 Language Report" (which is included).
 .
 It also contains the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) addendum
 and the Hierarchical Modules addendum in PS and PDF formats.
