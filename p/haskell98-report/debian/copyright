The haskell-doc collection of documentation was first put together by
Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>.

On 24 Nov 2002
* Ian Lynagh took over as Debian maintainer
* Ian Lynagh and Ganesh Sittampalam took over as upstream editors.

The report was then split off from haskell-doc into this new package.
The source is available by checking out haskell-report in the CVS
repository at :pserver:anoncvs@glass.cse.ogi.edu:/cvs (password: cvs).
