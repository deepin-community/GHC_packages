haskell-quickcheck1 (1.2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Packaged the old version since its API differs from version 2's and
    people still widely use it.
  * Set to provide, and replace and conflict with earlier versions of
    libghc6-quickcheck-*.
  * Moved .haddock file to avoid conflict with libghc6-quickcheck-doc.
