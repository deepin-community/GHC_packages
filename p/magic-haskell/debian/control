Description: File type determination library for Haskell
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This package provides a Haskell interface to the C libmagic library.
 With it, you can determine the type of a file by examining its contents
 rather than its name.  The Haskell interface provides a full-featured
 binding.
