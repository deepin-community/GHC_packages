Section: haskell
Architecture: any
Suggests: ${haskell:Suggests}
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${haskell:Depends}, libmagic-dev, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: File type determination library for Haskell
 This package provides a Haskell interface to the C libmagic library.
 With it, you can determine the type of a file by examining its contents
 rather than its name.  The Haskell interface provides a full-featured
 binding.
 .
 This package is built for GHC.  A Hugs package is also available
 in libhugs-magic.
