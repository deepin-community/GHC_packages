Description: Generic support for list-like structures
 Generic support for list-like structures in Haskell.
 .
 The ListLike module provides a common interface to the various Haskell
 types that are list-like.  Predefined interfaces include standard
 Haskell lists, Arrays, ByteStrings, and lazy ByteStrings.  Custom
 types can easily be made ListLike instances as well.
 .
 ListLike also provides for String-like types, such as String and
 ByteString, for types that support input and output, and for types that can
 handle infinite lists.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
