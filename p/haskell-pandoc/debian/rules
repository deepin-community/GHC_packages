# Override the 'build-ghc-stamp' rule and run 'build_recipe' twice.
# This is an ugly work-around for https://bugs.debian.org/1070015.
# This appears to be a GHC bug, and even though build fails the first
# time on armel, it succeeds with the next try.
# We should remove this as soon as GHC works correctly.
