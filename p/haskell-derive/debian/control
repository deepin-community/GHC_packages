Description: Deriving instances for data types in Haskell${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 Data.Derive is a library and a tool for deriving instances for Haskell
 programs.  It is designed to work with custom derivations, SYB and
 Template Haskell mechanisms.  The tool requires GHC, but the generated
 code is portable to all compilers.  This tool can be regarded as a
 competitor to DrIFT.
