.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBXtract\fP and \fBXtractLazy\fP are structured \(oqgrep\(cq-like programs for XML documents, loosely based on the XPath and XQL query languages.
\fBXtract\fP takes an \fIpattern\fP and reads an XML file from a file or from the standard input and extracts information from the XML file and prints it on the standard output.
\fBXtractLazy\fP does the same as \fBXtract\fP but uses the lazy parser combinators instead of the normal parser combinators and a such works faster and uses less memory than \fbXtract\fP.
