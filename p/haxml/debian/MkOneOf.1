.SH NAME
MkOneOf \- a helper program to use with DtdToHaskell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B MkOneOf
n [m]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDtdToHaskell\fP translates XML DTD into equivalent Haskell types.
When there is a choice between different tags, \fBDtdToHaskell\fP uses types like OneOf2, OneOf3, OneOf4, etc.
The module Text.XML.HaXml.OneOfN currently defines these types up OneOf20.
If your DTD requires larger choices, you can use this program to generate them.
.PP
\fBMkOneOf\fP takes an integer \fBN\fP or an integer range \fBN M\fP and writes to the standard output a Haskell module with respectively the datatype OneOf\fBN\fP or the datatypes OneOf\fBN\fP up to and including OneOf\fBM\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
If we run "MkOneOf 1 2", the program will print
.nf
module Text.XML.HaXml.OneOfN where

import Text.XML.HaXml.Xml2Haskell

data OneOf1 a
    = OneOf1 a
    deriving (Eq,Show)

instance (XmlContent a)
    => XmlContent (OneOf1 a)
  where
    fromElem cs =
        (choice OneOf1
        $ (\c->(Nothing,c))) cs
    toElem (OneOf1 x) = toElem x

----
data OneOf2 a b
    = OneOf2 a | TwoOf2 b
    deriving (Eq,Show)

instance (XmlContent a,XmlContent b)
    => XmlContent (OneOf2 a b)
  where
    fromElem cs =
        (choice OneOf2 $ choice TwoOf2
        $ (\c->(Nothing,c))) cs
    toElem (OneOf2 x) = toElem x
    toElem (TwoOf2 x) = toElem x
