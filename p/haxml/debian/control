Description: utilities for using XML documents with Haskell
 .
 HaXml is a collection of utilities for parsing, filtering,
 transforming, and generating XML documents using Haskell. Its basic
 facilities include:
  - a parser for XML,
  - a separate error-correcting parser for HTML,
  - an XML validator,
  - pretty-printers for XML and HTML.
 .
 This package contains the HaXml command-line tools.
