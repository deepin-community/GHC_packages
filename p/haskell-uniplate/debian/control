Package: libghc6-uniplate-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: ${haskell:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: libghc6-uniplate-doc (= ${source:Version})
Description: A Haskell library for uniform type generic traversals
 .
 The Haskell Uniplate library abstracts over common traversals and queries in a
 simple manner allowing the user to scrap their boilerplate code.
 .
 A more complete document on the Uniplate class was published at the Haskell
 Workshop 2007 (http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/uniplate/),  along with a
 video presentation, and the associated thesis chapter.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
