Description: A binary serialization library
 A binary serialization library, similar to binary, that introduces an isolate
 primitive for parser isolation, and replaces the asynchronous errors with a
 user-handleable Either type.  Similar to binary in performance, but uses a
 strict ByteString instead of a lazy ByteString, thus restricting it to
 operating on finite inputs.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
