Description: Fork threads and wait for their result
 This package provides functions to fork threads and wait for their result,
 whether it's an exception or a normal value.
 .
 Besides waiting for the termination of a single thread this package also
 provides functions to wait for a group of threads to terminate.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
