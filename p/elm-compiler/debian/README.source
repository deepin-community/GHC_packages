elm-compiler for Debian
=======================

To build this package, ssome extra Elm packages referenced in various
elm.json files) are required.

Those are not part of the elm/compiler source distribution. To avoid
downloads at build time, they are provided in a separate orig tarball
which has been created (and can be reproduced) using
debian/make-packages-origtar.sh.
