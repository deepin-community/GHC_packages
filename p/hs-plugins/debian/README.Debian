hs-plugins for Debian
=====================

hs-plugins documentation in HTML form can be found at:
  http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/

The HTML documentation is not included in the Debian package as building it
requires tex2page which is not available on all architectures supported by
Debian.
