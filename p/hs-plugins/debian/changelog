hs-plugins (1.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Marco Túlio Gontijo e Silva ]
  * debian/control: Use one package for line in dependencies.
  * debian/rules: Make build depend only in build-arch to avoid building
    indep packages in all architectures.

  [ Joachim Breitner ]
  * Depend on hscolour in Build-Depends-Indep, fixes FTBFS (does not affect
    binNMUs, so no hurry needed) (Closes: #537000)
  * Use newest cdbs, to be able to use build docs in build-indep and
    still be buildd-friendly

  [ Marco Túlio Gontijo e Silva ]
  * debian/control: Use more sintetic name for Vcs-Darcs.
  * debian/control: Change Priority: to extra.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * debian/rules: Do not install .haddock file in -doc package.
    haskell-devscripts now installs these in -dev packages, but we did not
    take into account the fact that hs-plugins installs the doc package
    manually and so the same file was available in both packages, which led to
    file conflicts and uninstallability. (Closes: #542624)
  * debian/control: Add Vcs-Browser 

  [ Joachim Breitner ]
  * Bump standards version (no change)

hs-plugins (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Typo in rules causing directory debian/@ to appear
  * Do nothing in build-indep, and all in binary-indep, to work around current
    buildd vs. policy situation WRT Build-Depends-Indep.

 -- Joachim Breitner <nomeata@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Jul 2009 01:56:27 +0200

hs-plugins (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 
  * Adopt for the Debian Haskell Group
  * Re-do packaging based on haskell-devscripts
    + Build -prof package
    + Build the (non-API) documentation as html and PDF
    + Slightly update debian/copyright
    + rm debian/libghc6-plugins-dev.examples, no examples shipped any more

hs-plugins (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/rules: 
    - Don't build architecture independent packages on the buildd.
  * debian/control:
    - Add libghc6-haskell-src-doc to the Build-Depends-Indep so 
      ./setup haddock can generate references to that package.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Fix lintian warning "debian-copyright-line-too-long"
  * debian/mk-haskell-depends: Removed. Use dh_haskell_depends from
    haskell-devscripts
  * Set urgency to high as this upload fixes a FTBFS on the buildd 
    which is holding hs-plugins out of testing/lenny.

hs-plugins (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Builds and works with GHC 6.8.2 (Closes: #460374, #402245) 
  * debian/control:
    - Add a libghc6-plugins-doc package (Closes: #407441)
    - Add myself as an Uploader.
    - Add ghc6-doc and haddock to Build-Depends-Indep. Also add mzscheme
      as it provides the tex2page binary.
    - Add cpphs to the Build-Conflicts as ./setup haddock fails when we
      use cpphs instead of cpp. 
    - Switch from tetex to texlive.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use my 'standard' debian/rules for Haskell libraries as base.
    - Let build-indep-stamp depend on build-arch-stamp as ./setup haddock
      needs some .h files which are generated during the build-indep-stamp
      target.
  * debian/watch: uscan watch file added.

hs-plugins (0.9.10-3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Register package with ghc-pkg update instead of ghc-pkg --add-package
