Description: Dynamically Loaded Haskell Modules
 hs-plugins is a library for loading plugins written in Haskell into an
 application at runtime. It also provides a mechanism for (re)compiling
 Haskell source at runtime. Thirdly, a combination of runtime compilation
 and dynamic loading provides a suite of eval functions. Values exported
 by plugins are transparently available to Haskell host applications, and
 bindings exist to use Haskell plugins from at least C and Objective C
 programs.
