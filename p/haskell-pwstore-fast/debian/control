Description: secure password storage${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 To store passwords securely, they should be salted, then hashed with a
 slow hash function. This library uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all
 the details. It uses the cryptohash package for speed; if you need a
 pure Haskell library, pwstore-purehaskell has the exact same API, but
 uses only pure Haskell. It is about 25 times slower than this package,
 but still quite usable.
