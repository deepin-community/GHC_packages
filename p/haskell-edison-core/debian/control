Package: libghc6-edison-core-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: ${haskell:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: ${haskell:Suggests}
Description: Haskell library of efficent, purely-functional data structures
 Some concrete implementations of the abstract interface of the Edison
 library for Haskell for use with ghc6.
 .
 Edison is a library of purely function data structures for Haskell
 originally written by Chris Okasaki. Conceptually, it consists of two
 things:
   - A set of type classes defining data the following data structure
     abstractions: 'sequences', 'collections' and 'associative
     collections'
   - Multiple concrete implementations of each of the abstractions
 .
 This package contains the concrete implementations.
