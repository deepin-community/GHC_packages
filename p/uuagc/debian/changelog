uuagc (0.9.4~snapshot20070422-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot release:
    -  The attribute flow analysis has been completely implemented by
       Joost Verhoog, and it is now possible to generate visit-function
       based evaluators, which are much faster and use less space. We
       assume that such functions are strict in all their arguments, and
       generate the appropriate `seq` calls to make the GHC aware of
       this. As a result also case expressions are generated instead of
       let expressions wherever possible.
     - The base system has been extended by Jeroen Fokker with wildcard
       notations for designating groups of productions, attributes etc.
  * Cleanup debian/rules file.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Update copyright statements.
  * debian/uuagc.1: 
    - Include the new options.
    - Update copyright statements.

uuagc (0.9.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/changelog: fix spelling error.
  * Stop using update-haskell-control and $ghc6_* variables, as it is not
    necessary and not using it simplifies the work for porters and for me.
