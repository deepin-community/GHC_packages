Description: Haskell DSL for writing JavaScript programs - GHC 6 libraries
 HJScript is a DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of
 HJavaScript, for writing client-side dynamic web pages. The programming
 model is fairly low-level, resembling the actual JavaScript code quite a
 lot, but should be easy to extend with higher-level functionality.
 Notable is that HJScript supports the use of literal XML syntax, as
 defined by the hsx package, for creating DOM ElementNodes. Also notable
 is that HJScript supports Ajax functionality.
 .
 If you don't know what Haskell and all these concepts are, you can just
 ignore this package.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
