.TH THREADSCOPE 1 "June 28, 2010"
.SH NAME
threadscope \- a graphical thread profiler for Haskell GHC programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR threadscope
.RI [ program.eventlog ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Threadscope
is a graphical thread profiler for Haskell programs.
.br
.sp 1
It parses and displays the content of .eventlog files emitted
by the GHC 6.12.1 and later runtimes, showing a timeline of
spark creation, spark-to-thread promotions and garbage collections.
.br
.sp 1
This helps debugging the parallel performance of Haskell programs,
making easier to check that work is well balanced across the available
processors and spot performance issues relating to garbage collection
or poor load balancing.
.PP
.SH ARGUMENTS
.BR threadscope
takes the name of the GHC RTS event-log file to process as its
single argument. If no filename is given,
.BR threadscope
starts with an empty workspace, where any event-log file can be
loaded by means of the GUI file browser facilities.
.SH USAGE
In order for
.BR threadscope
to be useful, you have to compile your Haskell program to use GHC's
threaded run-time and also to create runtime profile logs. This can
be accomplished with the following command line options to
.BR ghc (1)
.sp 2
.RS 4
$ ghc -threaded -eventlog --make Foo.hs -o foo
.RE
.sp 2
Once the program is built, execute it using the multithreaded
run-time, specifying the number of HECs (Haskell Execution Contexts)
to use in the usual manner, but also requesting the creation of an
event log. For example, to use two HECs and create an event log
you would use
.sp 2
.RS 4
$ foo +RTS -N2 -ls -RTS ...
.RE
.sp 2
Once the program runs to completion, a file named foo.eventlog
is produced. You can start
.BR threadscope
from the shell prompt passing the event-log filename as the single
argument, or you can start
.BR threadscope
from the desktop menus and use its file browsing capabilities to
find and open it.
