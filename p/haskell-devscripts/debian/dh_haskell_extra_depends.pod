dh_haskell_extra_depends - generate the extra-depends file in Haskell packages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_extra_haskell_depends> [S<I<debhelper options>>]
[B<-X>I<package>]
[B<--exclude=>I<package>]
[S<I<file>> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_haskell_extra_depends is a debhelper program that helps with calculating dependencies
for building Haskell libraries.

Since Haskell libraries are statically linked, packagers that use Haskell
libraries cannot rely on the fact that dynamical libraries are dependencies
of their packages to be sure that possible runtime data packages are installed
at execution time. The extra dependencies mechanism allows libraries
to declare some packages that are to be added to the dependency list of
each package that uses them to build.

This script scans the Haskell dependencies and harvest extra dependencies
information, putting them in the file debian/extra-depends, which is later
used by dh_haskell_depends to be included in the substvars file.

=head1 BUGS

None, as far as we know. :-)
