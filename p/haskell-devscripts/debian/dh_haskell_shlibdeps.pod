[B<-X>I<package>]
[B<--exclude=>I<package>]
[S<I<file>> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_haskell_shlibdeps is a debhelper program that helps with calculating
external dependencies for building Haskell libraries.

It automates building libraries for the different supported Haskell systems in
Debian.

This script writes the debian/$package.substvars file, including in it the
shlibs:Depends variable.  So, to use this package, include in the Depends:
field in debian/control ${shlibs:Depends}.

=head1 BUGS

hugs and ghc are the only supported targets at the moment.  Cabal does
not yet support nhc98.
