=head1 NAME

dh_haskell_depends - calculates Haskell dependencies on Cabalized libraries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_haskell_depends> [S<I<debhelper options>>]
[B<-X>I<package>]
[B<--exclude=>I<package>]
[S<I<file>> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_haskell_depends is a debhelper program that helps with calculating dependencies
for building Haskell libraries.

It automates building libraries for the different supported Haskell systems in
Debian.

This script writes the debian/$package.substvars file, including in it the
haskell:Depends, haskell:Recommends, haskell:Suggests and haskell:Extra-Depends
variable.  So, to use this package, include in the Depends: field in debian/control
${haskell:Depends}, and do the same for Recommends, Suggests and Extra-Depends.

=head1 BUGS

hugs and ghc are the only supported targets at the moment.  Cabal does
not yet support nhc98.
