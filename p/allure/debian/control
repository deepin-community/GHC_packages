Description: near-future Sci-Fi roguelike and tactical squad game
 Allure of the Stars is a near-future Sci-Fi roguelike and tactical
 squad game.
 .
 Not a single picture in this game. You have to imagine everything
 yourself, like with a book (a grown-up book, without pictures).
 Once you learn to imagine things, though, you can keep exploring
 and mastering the world and making up stories for a long time.
 .
 The game is written in Haskell using the free software LambdaHack engine.
 Please see the changelog file for recent improvements
 and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long term goals
 are high replayability and auto-balancing through procedural
 content generation and persistent content modification
 based on player behaviour. Contributions are welcome.
