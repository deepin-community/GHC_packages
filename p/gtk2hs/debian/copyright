    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
    SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS CC0 WAIVER DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON
    AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
    INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    ITS USE.

    Statement of Purpose

    The laws of various jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
    certain exclusive rights upon the creator of an original work of authorship
    and/or a database (each, a “Work”), and the subsequent owners thereof.

    Some owners of these exclusive rights wish to permanently remove these
    restrictions from a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons that
    the public can reliably build upon, modify, reuse and redistribute as
    freely as possible from such restrictions for any purposes and in any form
    whatsoever, whether modified or unmodified, in whole or in part. Such
    owners therefore wish to fully, permanently, irrevocably and
    unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish their Copyright Related
    Rights (defined below) with respect to a Work to the fullest extent
    permitted by applicable law.

    A Work associated with this CC0 Waiver may be protected by copyright and
    related or neighboring rights, database rights (such as those arising under
    Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
    1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
    implementation thereof, (including any amended or successor version of such
    directive)), and/or other similar equivalent or corresponding rights
    throughout the world as such rights may be available under applicable law
    or treaty (and national implementations thereof), including but not limited
    to moral rights retained by the original author(s), publicity and privacy
    rights pertaining to an individual’s image or likeness depicted in a Work,
    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to the Work, and
    any rights protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse of data in
    the Work (such rights all, collectively, the “Copyright Related Rights”).

    The person associating this CC0 Waiver with a Work is the owner of
    Copyright Related Rights in the Work (the “Affirmer”), and does openly,
    overtly and voluntarily elect to apply this CC0 Waiver to his or her Work
    with knowledge of his or her Copyright Related Rights in the Work and the
    meaning and intended legal effect of this CC0 Waiver.

    Subject to rights of other persons in the Work, and any patent and
    trademark rights held by Affirmer, by associating this CC0 Waiver with a
    Work the Affirmer does intend to fully, permanently, irrevocably and
    unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish all of his or her Copyright
    Related Rights in such Work, to the fullest extent permitted by (but not in
    contravention of) applicable law.

    CC0 Waiver

    1.  To the fullest extent permitted by (but not in contravention of)
    applicable law, Affirmer hereby fully, permanently, irrevocably and
    unconditionally waives, abandons and relinquishes all of Affirmer’s
    Copyright Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
    whether present or future, vested or contingent, in the Work, (such waiver,
    abandonment, and relinquishment, the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver
    for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment
    of Affirmer's heirs or successors.

    2. Should the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
    ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the
    maximum extent permitted and Affirmer hereby grants to each such affected
    recipient of the Work a worldwide, royalty-free, non exclusive, perpetual
    (for the duration of the applicable copyright), non transferable, non
    sublicensable, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s
    Copyright Related Rights in the Work, which license shall be deemed
    effective as of the date this CC0 Waiver was applied by Affirmer to the
    Work.

    3. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    relinquished, licensed or otherwise affected by this CC0 Waiver.

    4. Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims responsibility for
    clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any intended
    use thereof, including without limitation any such person’s Copyright
    Related Rights (including privacy and publicity rights). Further, Affirmer
    hereby fully and completely disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for such intended
    use.

    5. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not party
    to this CC0 Waiver and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0
    Waiver or use of the Work.
