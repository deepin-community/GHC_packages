License: CC0
 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
 SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS CC0 WAIVER DOES NOT CREATE AN
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON
 AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
 INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
 ITS USE.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of various jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 certain exclusive rights upon the creator of an original work of authorship
 and/or a database (each, a “Work”), and the subsequent owners thereof.
 .
 Some owners of these exclusive rights wish to permanently remove these
 restrictions from a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons that
 the public can reliably build upon, modify, reuse and redistribute as
 freely as possible from such restrictions for any purposes and in any form
 whatsoever, whether modified or unmodified, in whole or in part. Such
 owners therefore wish to fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish their Copyright Related
 Rights (defined below) with respect to a Work to the fullest extent
 permitted by applicable law.
 .
 A Work associated with this CC0 Waiver may be protected by copyright and
 related or neighboring rights, database rights (such as those arising under
 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
 implementation thereof, (including any amended or successor version of such
 directive)), and/or other similar equivalent or corresponding rights
 throughout the world as such rights may be available under applicable law
 or treaty (and national implementations thereof), including but not limited
 to moral rights retained by the original author(s), publicity and privacy
 rights pertaining to an individual’s image or likeness depicted in a Work,
 rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to the Work, and
 any rights protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse of data in
 the Work (such rights all, collectively, the “Copyright Related Rights”).
 .
 The person associating this CC0 Waiver with a Work is the owner of
 Copyright Related Rights in the Work (the “Affirmer”), and does openly,
 overtly and voluntarily elect to apply this CC0 Waiver to his or her Work
 with knowledge of his or her Copyright Related Rights in the Work and the
 meaning and intended legal effect of this CC0 Waiver.
 .
 Subject to rights of other persons in the Work, and any patent and
 trademark rights held by Affirmer, by associating this CC0 Waiver with a
 Work the Affirmer does intend to fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish all of his or her Copyright
 Related Rights in such Work, to the fullest extent permitted by (but not in
 contravention of) applicable law.
 .
 CC0 Waiver
 .
 1.  To the fullest extent permitted by (but not in contravention of)
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons and relinquishes all of Affirmer’s
 Copyright Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
 whether present or future, vested or contingent, in the Work, (such waiver,
 abandonment, and relinquishment, the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver
 for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment
 of Affirmer's heirs or successors.
 .
 2. Should the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the
 maximum extent permitted and Affirmer hereby grants to each such affected
 recipient of the Work a worldwide, royalty-free, non exclusive, perpetual
 (for the duration of the applicable copyright), non transferable, non
 sublicensable, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s
 Copyright Related Rights in the Work, which license shall be deemed
 effective as of the date this CC0 Waiver was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work.
 .
 3. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 relinquished, licensed or otherwise affected by this CC0 Waiver.
 .
 4. Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims responsibility for
 clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any intended
 use thereof, including without limitation any such person’s Copyright
 Related Rights (including privacy and publicity rights). Further, Affirmer
 hereby fully and completely disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
 necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for such intended
 use.
 .
 5. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not party
 to this CC0 Waiver and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0
 Waiver or use of the Work.
