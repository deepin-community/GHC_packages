Description: Upstream changes introduced in version 7.0.2-4
 This patch has been created by dpkg-source during the package build.
 Here's the last changelog entry, hopefully it gives details on why
 those changes were made:
 .
 ghc (7.0.2-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   * ghc6-preinst: Remove package.cache file of any ghc6 installation to avoid
     dpkg warning at upgrade time. TO BE TESTED BEFORE UPLOADING
   * Build-conflict with ccache. pbuilder installs ccache by default, which
     causes ghc to pick up a wrong path for "gcc".
   * Pass -lpthread everywhere. This can possibly be dropped later.
 .
