Description: Haskell support for regexp based pattern matching${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension that extends
 the normal pattern matching facility, allowing the user to match against
 regular expressions. This expressive power is highly useful in a wide
 range of areas, including text parsing and XML processing. Regular
 expression patterns in HaRP work over ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of
 arbitrary type. HaRP is implemented as a pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.
