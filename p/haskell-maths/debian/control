Description: Combinatorics, group theory, (non-)commutative algebra
 A library of maths code in the areas of combinatorics, group theory,
 commutative algebra, and non-commutative algebra. The library is mainly
 intended for educational purposes, but does have efficient
 implementations of several fundamental algorithms.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
