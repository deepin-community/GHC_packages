haskell-yesod-json (0.2.1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Slightly bump the version in the cabal field to 0.2.1.0.1. Otherwise,
    cabal-install will use the dependency information from hackage, trying to
    re-install yesod-json using aeson-native. This dependency was changed in
    0.2.1 to aeson in Debian.
    Also see http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/884 for a proper
    solution.
