haskell-hsql-postgresql (1.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make postgresql-server-dev-8.[34] a Build-Conflicts (Closes: 559583)
    If this package is present at build-time, the resulting ghc-pkg info will
    reference a directory from it in Includes, causing the installation to
    fail (see #471786). But if it is not, everything goes well and we have one
    dependency less.
  * Change priority to extra
  * Bump standards version, no change
  * Clean PostgreSQL.buildinfo
