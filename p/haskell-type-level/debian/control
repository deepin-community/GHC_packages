Description: A Haskell library for type-level programming
 A haskell library for performing computations on the type-level. Type-level
 functions are implemented using functional dependencies of multi parameter
 type classes. To date, Booleans and Numerals (Naturals and Positives) are
 supported. With regard to Numerals, there is support for common arithmetic
 operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division, exponientation,
 logarithm, maximum, comparison, GCD) over natural numbers (using a decimal
 representation to make compile-time errors friendlier). Although making use
 of type-level computations might seem devious and obfuscated at first sight,
 it is indeed useful in practice to implement lightweight dependent types
 such as number-parameterized types (e.g. an array type parameterized by the
 array's size or a modular group type Zn parameterized by the modulus).
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
