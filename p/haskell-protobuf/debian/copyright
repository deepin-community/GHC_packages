Comment:
 The files LICENSE.* are copies of the licenses for Google's Protocol
 Buffers implementation, and the Haskell library protocol-buffers.
 Upstream included these in this library's tarball for unknown
 reasons.
 .
 There is no code from either of these projects in this library.
 Google's Protocol Buffers includes no Haskell code.  And the Haskell
 library protocol-buffers exports modules in the Text hierarchy, but
 this library exports modules in the Data hierarchy.  This project
 contains no data files or other includes; it is pure Haskell.
