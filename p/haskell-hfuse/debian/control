Description: Haskell binding for the Linux FUSE library
 HFuse is a Haskell binding to the Linux C library, FUSE ('Filesystems in
 Userspace'); FUSE allows you to construct interesting filesystems which
 can be used in many ways, such as a filesystem in which the files are
 Wikipedia files, or SSHFS where one mounts remote directories over SSH,
 or FlickrFS which represents your Flickr account as directories and files.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
