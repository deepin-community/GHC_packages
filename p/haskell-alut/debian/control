Description: Haskell ALUT binding for GHC
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 .
 This library provides a Haskell binding for the OpenAL Utility Toolkit,
 which makes managing of OpenAL contexts, loading sounds in various formats
 and creating waveforms very easy. For more information about the
 C library on which this binding is based, please see:
 <http://www.openal.org/openal_webstf/specs/alut.html>.
