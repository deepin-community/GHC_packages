Description: A library for tracking the consumption of a lazy ByteString${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 In some cases, it is useful to know how fast a ByteString is being
 consumed. Typically, this could be to report some measure of progress
 to a waiting user, but it could also be to perform some form of testing
 on input / consumption code.
