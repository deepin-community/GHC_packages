Description: Haskell library for strongly typed heterogeneous collections
 A heterogeneous collection is a datatype that is capable of storing
 data of different types, while providing operations for look-up,
 update, iteration, and others. There are various kinds of
 heterogeneous collections, differing in representation, invariants,
 and access operations.
 .
 HList is a Haskell library providing strongly typed heterogeneous
 collections including extensible records.
