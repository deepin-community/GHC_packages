Description: small but solid library for FRP${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 The current focus of this library is to implement a subset of the semantic
 model for functional reactive programming pioneered by Conal Elliott.
 .
 Moreover, this library can hooked into any existing event-based framework.
 It is especially useful in conjunction with existing GUI frameworks like
 wxHaskell or gtk2hs.
 .
 This also means that your code can be a mix of FRP and imperative parts.
 Bored of programming imperative GUIs? Write some parts with FRP! Don't know
 how to express something with FRP? Switch back to imperative style!
 .
 In the spectrum of possible FRP implementations, this one features simple
 semantics but modest expressivity. Predicting space & time usage should be
 easy.
 .
 Stability forecast: Known inefficiencies that will be addressed. No
 semantic bugs expected. Significant API changes are likely in future
 versions.
