xmobar (0.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Beginning with 0.19, the Com configuration directive does not use a shell to
  run the commands specified anymore. If you're using shell expansion or pipes
  in your Com statements, you should change them to call a shell explicitly,
  e.g.:

    Run Com "/bin/bash" ["-c", "~/bin/script"]
    Run Com "/bin/bash" ["-c", "~/bin/other_script | head -n 1"]

  Also beginning with 0.19, xmobar supports an alternate configuration file
  location, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xmobar/xmobarrc (default: ~/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc).
  See the xmobar(1) manpage for more details.

xmobar (0.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  If you used the Battery or BatteryP monitors, please note that after 0.15
  they perform auto-discovery and so the "-c" argument is not needed anymore.
  Be sure to remove it from your .xmobarrc.

  Also, versions 0.15 and 0.16 introduced a number of new monitors, check out
  /usr/share/doc/xmobar/news.md.gz for more information.
