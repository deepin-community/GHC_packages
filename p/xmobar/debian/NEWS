xmobar (0.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

    If you used the Battery or BatteryP monitors, please note that after 0.15
    they perform auto-discovery and so the "-c" argument is not needed anymore.
    Be sure to remove it from your .xmobarrc.

    Also, versions 0.15 and 0.16 introduced a number of new monitors, check out
    /usr/share/doc/xmobar/news.md.gz for more information.
