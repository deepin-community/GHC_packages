.SH NAME
xmobar \- A configurable and extensible status bar for X11 desktops
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmobar
.RI [ OPTIONS ]\ [ CONFIG_FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
xmobar is a minimalistic, text based, status bar.
It was originally designed and implemented by Andrea Rossato to
work with \fBxmonad\fP, but it's actually usable with any window-manager.
.PP
xmobar was inspired by the \fBIon3\fP (http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/)
status bar, and supports similar features, like dynamic color
management, output templates, and extensibility through plugins.
.PP
This page documents xmobar 0.16.

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.PP
xmobar can be either configured with a configuration file or with
command line options. In the second case, the command line options will
overwrite the corresponding options set in the configuration file.

The default configuration file is assumed to lie in ~/.xmobarrc. See
/usr/share/doc/xmobar/examples for sample configuration files.
