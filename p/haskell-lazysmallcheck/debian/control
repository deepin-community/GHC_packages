Description: A library for demand-driven testing of Haskell programs
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 .
 Lazy SmallCheck is a library for exhaustive, demand-driven testing of
 Haskell programs.  It is based on the idea that if a property holds
 for a partially-defined input then it must also hold for all
 fully-defined refinements of the that input.  Compared to ``eager''
 input generation as in SmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require
 significantly fewer test-cases to verify a property for all inputs up
 to a given depth.
