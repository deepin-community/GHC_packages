Description: Darcs add-on that sends mail about newly pushed changes
 It is often desirable to send mail about new changes to software to
 a mailing list as soon as they are committed to a version control
 repository.  Darcs-monitor adds this functionality to Darcs, an
 advanced revision control system.
 .
 Darcs-monitor is most commonly used as a Darcs apply post-hook, so that
 email is sent as soon as changes are pushed to the repository under
 monitoring.
 .
 Mails sent by darcs-monitor are configurable, and they can contain
 the diff of the changes, as well as change metadata.
 .
 You will need a mail transport agent (MTA) such as Exim in all but
 the most unusual situations.
