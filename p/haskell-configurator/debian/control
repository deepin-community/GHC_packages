Description: dynamic config file reloading
 A configuration management library for programs and daemons.
 .
 Features include:
 .
 * Automatic, dynamic reloading in response to modifications to
 configuration files.
 .
 * A simple, but flexible, configuration language, supporting several
 of the most commonly needed types of data, along with
 interpolation of strings from the configuration or the system
 environment (e.g. $(HOME)).
 .
 * Subscription-based notification of changes to configuration
 properties.
 .
 * An import directive allows the configuration of a complex
 application to be split across several smaller files, or common
 configuration data to be shared across several applications.
 .
 This package contains the normal library files.
