.TH DJINN 1 "October 06 2013"
.SH NAME
djinn \- generate Haskell expressions from types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \fBdjinn\fP [\fIOPTION\fP ... ] [\fIFILE\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Djinn uses a theorem prover for intuitionistic propositional logic to
generate a Haskell expression when given a type.

Given a type the program will deduce an expression of this type, if one
exists. If the Djinn says the type is not realizable it is because there is
no (total) expression of the given type.
