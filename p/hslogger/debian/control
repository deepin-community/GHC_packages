Description: The Haskell Logging Framework, GHC package
 hslogger is a logging framework for Haskell, roughly similar to
 Python's logging module.
 .
 hslogger lets each log message have a priority and source be associated
 with it.  The programmer can then define global handlers that route
 or filter messages based on the priority and source.  hslogger also
 has a syslog handler built in.
