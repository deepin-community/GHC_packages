Description: Efficient hashing-based container types${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 It contains efficient hashing-based container types. The containers
 have been optimized for performance critical use, both in terms of
 large data quantities and high speed.
 .
 The declared cost of each operation is either worst-case or
 amortized, but remains valid even if structures are shared.
