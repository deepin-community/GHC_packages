Description: Parser and writer for sectioned config files in Haskell
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language. See
 http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 The ConfigFile module works with configuration files in a standard
 format that is easy for the user to edit, easy for the programmer
 to work with, yet remains powerful and flexible.  It is inspired by,
 and compatible with, Python's ConfigParser module.  It uses files
 that resemble Windows .INI-style files, but with numerous
 improvements.
 .
 ConfigFile provides simple calls to both read and write config files.
 It's possible to make a config file parsable by this module,
 the Unix shell, and make.
