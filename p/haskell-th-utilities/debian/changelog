    priority extra has been deprecated.
  * Use the HTTPS form of the copyright-format URL
  * Modify d/watch and Source field in d/copyright to use HTTPS

  [ Gianfranco Costamagna ]
  * Disable test on armhf, fails with unaligned accesses on an arm64 kernel
    (this isn't properly a fix, but hopefully nobody will run armhf on top
    of an arm64 kernel and this package)
