Description: Char-like utility functions for Word8s to be used with ByteStrings${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This is a Word8 library to be used with Data.ByteString. All function
 assumes that Word8 is encoded in Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1). All utility
 functions are supposed to work as if those of Char. Exceptions are
 described in the function documentations.
