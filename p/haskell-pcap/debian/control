Description: Haskell wrapper around the C libpcap library${haskell:ShortBlurb}
 This library provides Haskell bindings for most of the libpcap API as of
 libpcap version 0.9.7. The bindings are divided into a very efficient
 low-level wrapper, Network.Pcap.Base, and a higher-level module, Network.Pcap,
 that's easier to use.
