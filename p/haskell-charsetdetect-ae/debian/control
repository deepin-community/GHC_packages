Description: Character set detection using Mozilla's Universal Character Set Detector
 Mozilla have developed a robust and efficient character set detection algorithm for
 use in their web browsers.  The algorithm is able to detect all of the most frequently
 encountered character encodings totally automatically.
 .
 This library wraps up their library and exposes a very simple Haskell interface to it.
 The library is portable, and is confirmed to work on both Unix and Windows.
