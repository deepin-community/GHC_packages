Description: Haskell strict concurrency abstractions - GHC 6 libraries
 This package provides head normal form strict versions of some standard
 Haskell concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which provide control
 over where evaluation takes place not offered by the default lazy types.
 This may be useful for deciding when and where evaluation occurs,
 leading to improved time or space use, depending on the circumstances.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC 6.
