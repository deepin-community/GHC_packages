Description: GHC libraries for the Haskell O(ND) diff algorithm library
 This is a Haskell library providing an implementation of the O(ND) diff
 algorithm described in "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations"
 (1986) by Eugene W. Myers. It is O(mn) in space.
 .
 Whilst the algorithm is the same one used by standared Unix diff, the
 assumption is that users of this library will want to diff over interesting
 things or perform interesting tasks with the results.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
