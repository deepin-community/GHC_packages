haskell-edison-api (1.2.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopt haskell-edison for the Debian Haskell Group. Thanks to Arjan for his
    previous maintenance.
  * Edison has been split into multiple source package. Start with a debian
    revision of -10 to make sure the (still equally named) binary packages
    have increasing version numbers.
  * Make haskell-edison-api-doc conflict and replace haskell-edison-doc
  * Do packaging from scratch with a standard haskell-devscripts approach.
     + Adds -prof packages.

haskell-edison (1.2.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Bump build dependency on GHC to >= 6.8.2  because the package now
      needs a Cabal version >= 1.2.

 -- Arjan Oosting <arjan@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jan 2008 16:44:51 +0100

haskell-edison (1.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update for GHC 6.8.2:
    - debian/patches/01_update-cabal-file.dpatch:
      + Add array and containers to the Build-Depends which are libraries
        which are split of the base library.
      + Add FlexibleInstances, TypeSynonymInstances PatternSignatures and
        FlexibleContexts as needed Extensions.
      + Add -fglashow-exts to the Ghc-Options so GHC will parse
        unsafeCoerce# properly.
    - debian/patches/20_add-haddock-file.dpatch: Updated.
    - debian/rules:
      + The location of the package specification file has changes, so
        adjust the debian/rules file for that.
      + Add a link to the COPYRIGHT file in de edison-api and edison-core
        directories as the new Cabal version tries to install it and fails
        if it is missing.
      + Remove these links on clean.
      + Remove the installed COPYRIGHT files. No need to duplicate this
        information in the packages.
  * debian/control:
    - Replace Xs-Vcs-* fields with new official Vcs-* fields.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3. No changes needed.
    - Drop dctrl-tools from the build dependencies as the script using it
      is removed.
    - Add haskell-devscripts (>= 0.6.0) to the build dependencies because
      we user dh_haskell_depends.
    - Change the sections of the libghc-*-dev packages to libdevel to fix
      lintian warning "dev-package-should-be-section-libdevel".
  * debian/rules:
    - Replace call to debian/mk-haskell-depends script with call to
      dh_haskell_depends from haskell-devscripts.

haskell-edison (1.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Set urgency to high as this upload fixes a RC critical bug.
  * debian/control:
    - Use the new Homepage field.
  * debian/rules:
    - Make the determination of package names and versions more robust.
    - gcc 4.2.0 and higher cause FTFBS if we enable --split-objs during
     the compilation of haskell-edison. As a workaround we disable
     --split-objs if the gcc version >= 4.2.0 (Closes: #445754)

    - Update XS-Vcs-* fields as the packages has moved to the pkg-haskell
      subversion archive.
    - Add libghc6-mtl-prof and libghc6-quickcheck-prof to Build-Depends as
      libghc6-mtl-dev and libghc6-quickcheck-dev have split of their
      profiling libraries into seperate packages.
  * debian/{ghc6.in,rules}:
    - Add handling of noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS enviroment variable.
  * debian/{mk-haskell-depends,rules}:

      + Add libghc6-base-doc, libghc6-haskell98-doc, libghc6-mtl-doc and
        libghc6-quickcheck-doc to the Build-Depends-Indep so haddock can
        link to the names in other packages.
      + Add libghc6-base-doc, libghc6-haskell98-doc, libghc6-mtl-doc and
        libghc6-quickcheck-doc to the Recommends of haskell-edison-doc.
    - debian/patches/20_add-haddock-file.dpatch:
      + Add the appropriate --read-interface and --use-package options so
        haddock will link to names in other packages.

    - A new sequence implementation based on finger trees (similar to
      Data.Sequence in the base libs).
    - Documenation fixes dealing with the licence (the docs previously and
      incorrectly claimed Edison was under the BSD licence, when it is in
      fact the MIT license).

    to Build-Depends-Indep.

haskell-edison (1.2.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop using update-haskell-control and $ghc6_* variables, as it is not
    necessary and not using it simplifies the work for porters and for me.
  * debian/copyright:
    - include email from upstream with more information about the exact
      licensing.
  * debian/control.in:
    - add libghc6-mtl-dev and libghc6-quickcheck-dev to Build-Depends.
    - replace ${ghc:Depends} with ${haskell:Depends}
    - update maintainer email address.
  * debian/rules:
    - copy the actual package.conf file in which all installed packages
      are registered.
    - remove debian/ghc6 and debian/ghc-pkg6 on clean.
    - replace debian/mk-ghc6-vars script with debian/mk-haskell-depends
      script which determines all dependencies by using the installed
      package description file used by ghc-pkg.
