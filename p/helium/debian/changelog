helium (1.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make helium compile with GHC 6.8.2:
    - debian/patches/04_fixes-for-ghc6.dpatch: Add '-package containers'
      to the GHC options as helium uses Data.Map which is in a separate
      package now.
    - debian/control:
      + Add libghc6-parsec-dev to the build dependencies as the parsec
        module is in separate Debian package now.
      + Bump the build dependency on GHC to >= 6.8.2
  * debian/control:
    - Replace Xs-Vcs-* fields with Vcs-* fields.
    - Add Homepage field.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3. No changes needed.
  * debian/lvmrun.1:
    - Fix some spelling errors. Thanks A. Costa. (Closes: #442167)
  * debian/rules:
    - Export DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE as
      /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/README.Debian.gz suggests.

helium (1.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Add Xs-Vcs-Svn and Xs-Vcs-Browser fields.
  * debian/patches/06_no-strip.dpatch: Added. Do not strip binaries
    unconditionally. (Closes: #437172)
  * debian/rules:
    - Remove helium/src/codegeneration/CodeGeneration.hs on clean to keep
      the diff.gz small and tidy. The file will be created during the
      build.
    - Call 'make ag' before 'make depend' as it generates some Haskell
      source files needed in the depend target.
