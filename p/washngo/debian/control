Description: Web Authoring System for Haskell
 WASH is a family of embedded domain specific languages (EDSL) for
 programming Web applications. Each language is embedded in the
 functional language Haskell, which means that it is implemented as a
 combinator library.
 .
 Currently, WASH has the following components:
 .
 wash2hs, a preprocessor for including literal XHTML fragments in the
 style of Haskell Server Pages (HSP)
 .
 WASH/CGI for server-side web scripting
 .
 WASH/HTML for dynamic generation of HTML and XHTML
 .
 WASH/Mail for email processing
