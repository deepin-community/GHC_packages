Recommends: ${haskell:Recommends}
Provides: ${haskell:Provides}
Suggests: ${haskell:Suggests}
Description: Haskell library for Differences lists
 Differences lists: a list-like type supporting O(1) append.
 This is particularly useful for efficient logging and pretty
 printing, (e.g. with the Writer monad), where list append
 quickly becomes too expensive.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
