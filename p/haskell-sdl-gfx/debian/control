Description: Haskell SDL gfx binding for GHC
 This package provides the SDL gfx library bindings for the Haskell
 programming language. SDL gfx is an extension to the SDL library which
 provides basic antialiased drawing routines such as lines, circles or
 polygons, an interpolating rotozoomer for SDL surfaces, framerate control
 and MMX image filters.
