Description: Haskell SDL gfx binding for GHC
 This package provides the SDL gfx library bindings for the Haskell
 programming language. SDL gfx is an extension to the SDL library which
 provides basic antialiased drawing routines such as lines, circles or
 polygons, an interpolating rotozoomer for SDL surfaces, framerate control
 and MMX image filters.

Description: Haskell SDL gfx binding for GHC - profiling libraries
 This package provides the SDL gfx library bindings for the Haskell
 programming language, compiled for profiling. SDL gfx is an extension
 to the SDL library which provides basic antialiased drawing routines
 such as lines, circles or polygons, an interpolating rotozoomer for SDL
 surfaces, framerate control and MMX image filters.
