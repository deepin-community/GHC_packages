Description: D-Bus activity visualiser
 Bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of D-Bus
 calls for profiling and debugging purposes. It is intended to replace
 reading the cryptic output of dbus-monitor.
 .
 Calls are displayed using Message Sequence Charts, a succinct way of
 representing entities and interactions over time. It can also output
 data in Graphviz format.
 .
 This package contains the graphical visualizer for traces generated
 with the bustle-pcap tool in the bustle-pcap package.
