.SH NAME
bustle \- D-Bus visualiser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bustle
.RI logfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of D-Bus calls for
profiling and debugging. It is intended to replace reading the cryptic output
of \fBdbus-monitor\fP. Calls are displayed using Message Sequence Charts, a
succinct way of representing entities and interactions over time.
.PP
You may generate a dump using \fBbustle-pcap\fP  and pass its filename as an
argument to this command to visualise dbus calls saved previously.
