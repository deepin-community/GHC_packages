# The upstream makefile's "all" target rebuilds a bunch of files that
# are included in the source tarball.  This upsets dpkg-source -b if
# you rerun dpkg-buildpackage, because it looks like they were
# patched.
#
# It happens that the upstream makefile has a "distclean" target,
# which is too liberal, and a "maintainer-clean" target, which is too
# agressive; the latter deletes files that require _darcs to rebuild.
#
# Rather than patching upstream's distclean rule, we just extend the
# clean target here.  This is code duplication, but probably easier to
# understand and maintain.
