Description: an advanced revision control system
 Darcs is a revision control system, along the lines of CVS or arch.  That
 means that it keeps track of various revisions and branches of your
 project, allows for changes to propagate from one branch to another.
 Darcs is intended to be an ``advanced'' revision control system.  There
 are, in particular, two senses in which it is supposed to be advanced: 1)
 each copy of the source is a fully functional branch, and 2) underlying
 darcs is a consistent and powerful theory of patches.
