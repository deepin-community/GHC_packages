darcs (1.0.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * latex2html is non-free.  Removing dependencies on documentation
    generators.  According to David Roundy, this will cause configure to
    not rebuild the documentation.  (Closes: #348165).

darcs (1.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Difficulties building the documentation due to tex4ht segfault.  Can't
    find .env file.  Also makefile rules seem to be defective so that it's
    not possible to avoid building the documentation.  Remove tex4ht
    dependency and hope configure will pick up latex2html
    instead. (Closes: #347564).

 -- Isaac Jones <ijones@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Jan 2006 14:26:00 -0800

  * Since arguments can be mixed in any order, some bad error message
    shouldn't happen (Closes: #337683).
  * Upstream has indicated that performance should be better with this
    version.  If performance for gettext files is still not acceptable,
    please re-open this bug, or contact upstream with a performance report
    (Closes: #333992).

 -- Isaac Jones <ijones@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Nov 2005 13:56:23 -0800

  * No real changes.  Re-upload to trigger rebuild due to new ghc
    (Closes: #320156).
  * NOTE: 1.0.4 may be coming out very soon, but I thought it worthwhile
    to re-upload this package to get past the conflicts w/ ghc & grave bug.

 -- Isaac Jones <ijones@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Sep 2005 14:40:19 -0700

 -- Isaac Jones <ijones@debian.org>  Thu, 12 May 2005 07:50:36 -0700

darcs (1.0.2+1.0.3rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Funny version number to sort correctly when 1.0.3 is released.
  * From upstream announcement:
  * One of the most visible changes from 1.0.2 is the new colorization and
    escaping of printed patches, implemented by Tommy Pettersson. It can
    protect from maliciously inserted special characters and will show
    trailing spaces. Fine-grained customisation is possible through use of
    environment variables.
  * The other nice new feature, also implemented by Tommy, is the enhanced
    interface for unrecord and unpull, similar to that in pull. It allows to
    unrecord/unpull several patches at once, taking dependencies into
    account.
  * Benedikt Schmidt improved the add command to automatically add all
    parent directories of the added file. He also added --sendmail-command
    option to 'send' - it allows the user to send patch bundles with a
    program of his/her own choice.
  * Karel Gardas implemented an often requested change to whatsnew, namely
    that --look-for-adds implies --summary.
  * A number of bugs have been fixed since the previous release, most
    notably the mysterious "createDirectory bug" or the bug that made darcs
    insist that there is a conflict when there was none.

 -- Isaac Jones <ijones@debian.org>  Wed, 11 May 2005 22:01:02 -0700

darcs (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Darcs now has improved support for managing executable scripts
    through the addition of the '--set-scripts-executable' flag.

  * Ian Lynagh found and fixed a bug that caused mime decoding to fail,
    which could cause procmail scripts that apply signed darcs patches to
    fail.

  * David Roundy fixed a bug in the merger commute code which in rare
    conflicts could cause repository corruption.  There was also a fix for
    bug that caused a local get from a repository owned by another user
    (i.e. where you don't have write permission) to fail.

  * Juliusz Chroboczek contributed a couple of optimization features

  * See the "ChangeLog" file for a complete list of changes since 1.0.1.

  * now depends on exim4 instead of exim (closes: #290320)

 -- Isaac Jones <ijones@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Feb 2005 13:00:27 -0800

darcs (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Added a build-dependency and a recommendation on an MTA so that the
    configure scripts will be sure to enable "darcs send" and friends
    (closes: 283229).

  * There was one bad bug in version 1.0.0 and earlier which has the
    potential to cause repository corruption (closes: #287448).
    Unfortunately, fixing this bug means that darcs is less lenient in
    allowing certain types of patches to commute, which means you may have
    trouble interacting between darcs version 1.0.1 and earlier versions
    of darcs.  There is a page on the wiki devoted to this issue, so I'll
    say no more here, and just point you there:

    http://www.scannedinavian.org/DarcsWiki/Issues1_2e0_2e1

  * A bug fix that is almost perhaps a new feature is that the MAPI email
    code for windows had some fixes made, which may make this a workable
    feature for windows users.  Support for arbitrary transport protocols
    was added via the DARCS_GET_FOO, DARCS_MGET_FOO and DARCS_APPLY_FOO
    environment variables.  There was some work on optimizations, although
    I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes in which commands,
    since I haven't run timings myself.
  * See upstream changelog for more details about other bug fixes.

  * New upstream release
  * Now built with libcurl3 (Closes: #279469).
  * Various (upstream) bugs have been fixed most notably in the build

    with renamed files.
  * Since rc4 (not packaged) There have been a few documentation fixes, a
    compile error when configured with --enable-antimemoize, and a fix for
    a bug which showed up only when working with international characters.
