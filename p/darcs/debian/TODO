* Find testers for darcs-server.

I don't grok darcs-server, and can't get either the 1.x or 2.x
versions to work.  I'd like to drop the --datadir thing from rules,
but I don't know if this breaks darcs-server.

* Keep debian/ tree under version control.

* Move documentation into a separate darcs-doc package?

Lintian doesn't raise arch-dep-package-has-big-usr-share.  From
reading /usr/share/lintian/checks/huge-usr-share, the conditions for
this warning appear to be: package is architecture-dependent; and
/usr/share is over 2MB or constitutes at least 50% of package (by
size) and over 1MB.

Not considering this until lintian complains.
