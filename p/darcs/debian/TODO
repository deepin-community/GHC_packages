* Explicit licensing for all parts of darcs.

  See release/licensing for details.  Theoretically, Debian doesn't
  distribute packages that don't explicitly license all their bits.
  TWB is working with upstream to try to resolve this there.
  Discussion mainly happens on the darcs-user mailing list.

  Once done, need to update debian/copyright accordingly.

* Move documentation into a separate darcs-doc package?

Lintian doesn't raise arch-dep-package-has-big-usr-share.  From
reading /usr/share/lintian/checks/huge-usr-share, the conditions for
this warning appear to be: package is architecture-dependent; and
/usr/share is over 2MB or constitutes at least 50% of package (by
size) and over 1MB.

Not considering this until lintian complains.
