Description: listing network interfaces in Haskell - GHC library
 This library provides simple read-only access to the local computer's
 networking configuration. It is currently capable of getting a list of
 all the network interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
 addresses.
 .
 It has been tested and is known to work on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows XP.
 .
 This package contains the library compiled for GHC.
