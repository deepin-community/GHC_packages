haskell-cgi (3001.1.5.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to "Generic Haskell cabal library packaging files v10":
    * Versioned dependencies are now generated for the Cabal packages we
      depend on.
    * Use the new ${impl:ghc6:*_deps} variables in debian/control.in.
    * Call canonicalise-comma-list on the depends and suggests fields in
      control.in. This works around bugs in lintian, where it gets
      confused and starts giving spurious warnings.

  * Upgrade to "Generic Haskell cabal library packaging files v9":

    * The control.in gives a standards-version of 3.7.3 (was 3.7.2).
    * Move everything from the devel section to the libdevel section.
    * Delete the LICENSE file (currently we assume it has that name, and
      that it exists) after "Setup copy"ing the Cabal package.
    * Remove some hacks that worked around older Cabal not letting us
      tell it exactly where to put the documentation.
    * Use --hyperlink-source when telling Cabal to haddock the library.
    * Add hscolour to the build-depends.

haskell-cgi (3001.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to "Generic Haskell cabal library packaging files v8":
    * update-generated-files rule in debian/rules runs
      update-debian-haskell-files.
    * Build-dep on haddock >= 0.8-2 in order to get portable .haddock files.
    * We tell Cabal's configure where to put the docs so that it doesn't
      break when we move them around behind its back.
    * Use canonicalise-comma-list around the build-deps in debian/control.in
      to fix problems where we get an unparsable ", , " when a variable is
      empty.

haskell-cgi (2006.9.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to "Generic Haskell cabal library debian/rules v0.6".
    Tell setup to use ghc6 rather than ghc, so that the postinst/prerm
    scripts work when the ghc-pkg symlink doesn't exist or doesn't
    point to ghc6's ghc-pkg.
