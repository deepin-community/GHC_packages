This package was originally debianised by Erik de Castro Lopo
<erikd@mega-nerd.com>  Sat, 14 Mar 2009.

It was downloaded from the Haskell hackage repository at
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/bzlib

The Haskell source code and build materials in this package are under the
following BSD2 copyright, regardless of the fact that the file bzlib.cabal
in the distribution says BSD3. The Cabal file is machine readable by tools
in Haskell's Hackage repository, and unfortunately the code to read the
file does not accept BSD2 in the license field.
