haskell-src-exts (0.2.1~darcs20071212-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Bump urgency to high as this upload fixes a RC bug.
  * debian/control:
    - Let the Vcs-* fields point to the trunk branch.
    - Change the Section to libdevel as suggested by lintian warning
      "dev-package-should-be-section-libdevel".
  * debian/mk-haskell-depends: Removed. We use dh_haskell_depends from
    haskell-devscripts.
  * debian/rules:
    - Only optimise on i386, amd64 and ia64 as the optimisation of the
      parses can take a lot of memory. (Closes: #462848)

haskell-src-exts (0.2.1~darcs20071212-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream darcs snapshot release which compiles with GHC 6.8.2.
  * debian/control:
    - Use the official Vcs-* fields.
    - Add Homepage field.
    - Remove dctrl-tools from the Build-Depends as the
      debian/mk-haskell-depends script is removed.
    - Add a versioned dependency on haskell-devscripts for
      dh_haskell_depends.
    - Bump Standard-Version to 3.7.3. No changes needed.
    - Add some commented out binary stanzas for API documentation packages
      we might want to build in the future.
    - Bump the build dependency on ghc6 to 6.8.2 so we are sure we get the
      Cabal version 1.2 which is needed to build this package.
  * debian/{haskell-harp-doc,haskell-src-exts-doc}.docs: Added.
  * debian/rules:
    - Add some commented out code to generate API documentation. This does
      not work yet, due some parse error haddock is having.
    - Replace the call to debian/mk-haskell-depends with a call to
      dh_haskell_depends from haskell-devscripts.
    - Adjust the path to the .installed-pkg-config file which is now
      created by the new Cabal version as dist/installed-pkg-config
    - Adjust the regular expressions so the only match the Version and
      Name fields in the .cabal files.
  * Stop patching src/haskell-src-exts/Language/Haskell/Hsx/Lexer.hs as
    upstream fixed the compilation issue by renaming isSymbol to
    isHSymbol.

haskell-src-exts (0.2.1~darcs20070622-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built against GHC 6.6.1 (Closes: #429022)
  * New upstream darcs snapshot release:
    - Added line pragmas to output.
    - Added FFI support.
    - Added support for infix types.
    - Added mdo support.
    - Added support for foralls type definition.
  * The debian build system is replaced with the build system of
    haskell-edison which also generates multiple GHC libraries.
    The advantages are:
    - No need to use haskell-devscripts which is not really suited for
      multiple GHC libraries in one build.
    - No need to hardcode the version number in the debian/rules file.
    - No need to create links to the debian directory in the
      subdirectories.
    - Build with --enable-split-objs on i386 and amd64 which should result
      in smaller binaries.
  * debian/control:
    - Drop haskell-devscripts from the Build-Depends and add dctrl-tools
      which is need by the debian/mk-haskell-depends script.
    - Add myself to the Uploaders field.
    - Add X-Vcs-Svn and X-Vcs-Browser fields.
  * debian/{runcompiler,buildmod.sh}: Removed. No longer necessary.
  * debian/{postinst.in,prerm.in,ghc6.in,ghc6-pkg6.in,mk-haskell-depends}:
    Added. Needed for the new debian/rules file

    - /src/haskell-src-exts/Language/Haskell/Hsx/{Transform.hs,Pretty.hs}:
      modify some strings to keep cpp remove an invalid UTF sequence which
      upsets GHC 6.6
    - debian/rules: call ghc-pkg with --force when the haskell-src-exts
      library is registered during as some directories are missing.
