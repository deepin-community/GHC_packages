Suggests: ${haskell:Suggests}
Description: A command-line interface for user input, written in Haskell
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line
 programs. This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since it is
 written in Haskell it is (hopefully) more easily used in other Haskell
 programs.
 .
 Haskeline runs both on POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.

Description: A command-line interface for user input; profiling libraries
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language,
 compiled for profiling.
