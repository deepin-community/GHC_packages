Description: conditional and boolean operators with monadic variants
 This library provides:
 .
 * Implementations of various overloaded conditional operations
 .
 * Lifted monadic variants of those operations and common boolean operators
 .
 * A typeclass for boolean algebras.
 .
 Feel free to send ideas and suggestions for new conditional operators to the
 maintainer.
 .
 Monadic looping constructs are not included as part of this package, since the
 monad-loops package has a fairly complete collection of them already.
