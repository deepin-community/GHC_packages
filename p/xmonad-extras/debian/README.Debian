xmonad-extras for Debian
------------------------

Flag with_mpd is switched off, because otherwise xmonad-extras depends on
obsolete libmpd (==0.8.*). So, modules depending on libmpd are not built.

Flag with_hint is switched off, beacuse otherwise xmonad-extras depends on
obsolete hint (>=0.3 && <0.5). So, modules depending on hint are not built.
